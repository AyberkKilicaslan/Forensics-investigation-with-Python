# Forensics-investigation-with-Python

Recently it was discovered that DNA samples from human fingerprints are unique to individuals. Therefore,
it is possible to get samples from computer keyboards and identify who is using the computer. This task
provides very strong patterns and the recognition rate is high. However, the harder task is to detect which
hand (left or right) the samples are gathered from. In this project, the task is to identify which hand of
an individual touched the computer keyboard. This project involves assessing classification performance of
clinical data gathered from DNA data on computer keyboards. The task is to perform supervised learning
on the dataset and report the classification performance.


Data
There are 271 samples (first 136 left, second 135 right hands). Each sample contains 3302 features. Therefore
each file contains a table of 3302 x 271 entries. 136 of the samples are gathered from right-hand, and 135
are from left-hand. The dataset otu.csv is provided. The first row of the
files is the sample names, and the second row indicates if they are collected from left or right hands. Thay
all have the same data in different formats.
